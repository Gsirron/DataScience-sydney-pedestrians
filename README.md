# datascience-sydney-pedestrians

This is a quick Jupyter notebook used to brush up some python and data science skills.

Data was downloaded from the City of Sydney data hub [here](https://data.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/datasets/automatic-hourly-pedestrian-count/explore)

Used matplotlib, pandas and numpy to plot and visulise the data in graphs.
